# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, where I will build a simple recipe website using HTML. The goal is to practice structuring web pages with proper HTML elements.

## Project Overview
- The website will contain multiple pages with different recipes.
- Each recipe will have ingredients, instructions, and images.
- This project will focus purely on HTML without CSS or JavaScript (for now).

## Skills Demonstrated
- Creating structured HTML documents
- Using lists, headings, and links properly
- Organizing files in a project
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

This project serves as a foundation for learning web development and will be expanded with CSS and JavaScript in the future.
